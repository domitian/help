title: Where can I get my Registration Id/Test Id?
---



Registration id is a 12 digit no starting with EL which is unique for the test applied.  
After applying for a pH test, you can get your Registration Id in the Tests -> My Tests section of your eLitmus account.  
Test Id is same as that of Registration Id
