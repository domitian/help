title: My DD reached late. So I cannot take the pH test....

In case your DD reached us late, you need to go to the Tests --> My Tests section where you will find the link for reschedule. You can reschedule your pH test for a maximum of 3 times and within 3 months from the date of your first pH test date or DD received date which ever is later.
