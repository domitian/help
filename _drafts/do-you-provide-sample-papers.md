title: Do you provide sample papers?

No. We do not provide sample question papers. We don't think it is necessary for one to go through a sample paper to be able to perform better in pH test. The test is designed to measure your natural ability. You are not even expected to remember formulas while taking up the exam. All necessary formulas are given in the question paper itself.
